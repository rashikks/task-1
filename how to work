Goal: Find which services are running and what risks they might pose.
Method: I ran a fast, standard TCP SYN Scan ( -sS ) against my network range ( 10.0.0.15/24 -
IPs are hidden for privacy).
Result File: The raw data is saved in scan_results.txt .
Key Findings: Open Doors
The scan found open ports on two devices: my router and one Windows computer.

What it Does
10.0.0.1 53, 80,

DNS, HTTP,

Router's web management panel and basic network
services.
10.0.0.50 135, 139,
445
SMB/NetBIOS Windows File Sharing, allowing file transfer and remote
communication.
Security Analysis (Why it Matters)
Having these ports open isn't bad on its own, but they are common weak spots if not secured
correctly:
Router Ports (80/443): These let me manage the router through a browser. The risk is that if I'm
still using the default password or if the router's software (firmware) is outdated, an attacker
could take over the router and control my internet access.
Windows File Sharing Ports (139/445 - SMB): This is for sharing files on a Windows PC. This is a
very high risk because the SMB protocol has been targeted by major malware like WannaCry. If
the PC ( 10.0.0.50 ) is missing a single security update, a bad actor could exploit this port to run
code on the computer or access shared files.
✅ Next Steps
Based on these results, the most important action is to make sure the Windows PC ( 10.0.0.50 ) is
completely up-to-date with all Microsoft security patches to close any known weaknesses in the File
Sharing service.
